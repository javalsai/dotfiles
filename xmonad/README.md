# Installation
If you want to install xmonad there are very complete guides on internet like [this one](https://xmonad.org/INSTALL.html).
If you want it to look like mine just copy `xmonad.hs` to the path whre you installed xmonad (in my case it is `~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs`) and restart it, you can copy also the `build` file, but it's not necesary.

> [!WARNING]
> The file is very messy and there are things that still don't work (like changing brighness), but I'm working on them, by now you shouldn't copy the whole file, just look for lines that interest you and put them in your `xmonad.hs`.
>
> Some things that the file uses are `scrot`, `playerctl`, `amixer`, `xscreensaver`, `xclip`...
