# My Dotfiles
They contain dotfiles for my
* zsh
* vscodium (might work on VSC/OSS too)
* xmonad (wanna move to hyprland soon :o)
* wezterm (likely based off [Aylur's dotfiles](https://github.com/Aylur/dotfiles/tree/eww))
* nvim (started from [Rahul H.](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/neovim-configuration), highly different now)

If I'm missing any file or the instructions are poorly written, plese open an issue.
