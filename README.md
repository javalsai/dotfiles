# My Dotfiles
They contain dotfiles for my
* Zsh
* VSCodium
* Xmonad
* Wezterm (likely based off [Aylur's dotfiles](https://github.com/Aylur/dotfiles))
* Nvim (originated from [Rahul H.](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/neovim-configuration))

If I'm missing any file or the instructions are poorly written, plese open an issue.

*Nvim and Wezterm config have just been uploaded, I still have to document them and give credit to the people who started them, mine are just slightly tweaked*
